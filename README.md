# fluid

This is an adaptation of _"Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games"_  
by *Jos Stam* ([PDF here])(http://www.intpowertechcorp.com/GDC03.pdf)

The project was originally done in in April, 2011 (while I was at home & not working on the Domino's mobile app).

This code relied on what is now a very old version of Cocos2D (included); it is far from opitimized.

## Running the code

It runs with *Xcode 8* (to my surprise!).
