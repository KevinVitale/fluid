## Background

The project was originally done in April, 2011, (while at home and not working on the Domino's mobile app).

## Running the code

It runs with *Xcode 8* (to my surprise!). The code uses (what is now) a very old version of Cocos2D (included); it is far from opitimized.

## Demonstration
